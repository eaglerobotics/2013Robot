Added #define's to shooter subsystem and driveWithJoystick so that
the values easily idenitfied and changed if need be.


Deleted Feeder because it was redundant with the command Shoot.


Deleted runTheShooter becuase Jarrett reworked the Shooter code and broke it up into a subsystem called
Shooter and made functions that did the same thing as runTheShooter.
